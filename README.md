# üçû burnt

Cross-platform toasts, powered by native elements.

## Context

See this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1592923529644625920).

## What

This is a library with a `toast` and `alert` method for showing ephemeral UI. 

Currently, it only works on iOS, by wrapping [`SPIndicator`](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPIndicator) and [`SPAlert`](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPAlert).

Burnt works with the new architecture (+ old) and is built on top of JSI, thanks to Expo's new module system.

## Features

- Simple, imperative `toast` that uses **native** components under the hood, rather than using React state with JS-based UI.
- Animated icons
- 

## TODO

- [x] iOS support
- [ ] Android support (I probably won't build this myself, but maybe you could add it!)
- [ ] Web support (could be cool to use Radix UI...but maybe I'll leave that part up to Zeego)
- [ ] Custom iOS Icons

Chances are, I'll keep this lib to iOS-only (and maybe Android), and then another library can consume it to build a broader API out on the JS side, such as [Zeego](https://zeego.dev).

## Thanks

Expo Modules made this so easy to build, and all with Swift ‚Äì¬†no Objective C. It's my first time writing Swift, and it was truly a breeze.
